# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As development is still ongoing, please only submit vulnerabilities that affect the latest version of this repository.
To check that an identified vulnerability is still present, run `git checkout main; git pull` and then relocate the vulnerability.
A vulnerability **does not** need to be identified in code before it is reported;
as long as any behavior that is insecure persists, please do not hesitate to report it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This repository uses [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting process](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
To report a new potential vulnerability, navigate to the Security tab and create a new draft advisory, which will be reviewed by epispot maintainers within 2 days.
**Do not** create an issue or other public disclosure of the vulnerability, as that could put other users at risk.
